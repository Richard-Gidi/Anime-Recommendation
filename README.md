# Anime Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to build a content-based recommendation system for anime using the Anime dataset. The system will provide personalized anime recommendations to users based on their preferences.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the "Anime" dataset, which can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020). The dataset contains information about various anime, including their titles, synopses, genres, ratings, and more.

## Features
The key features of this project include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the Anime dataset to handle missing values, remove irrelevant columns, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and engineering relevant features from the dataset, such as text-based features (e.g., TF-IDF vectors of the anime synopses) and numeric features (e.g., ratings, popularity).
3. **Recommendation System**: Implementing a content-based recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to find the most similar anime based on user preferences or the features of a given anime.
4. **User Interface**: Providing a user-friendly interface (e.g., web application, Jupyter Notebook) for users to interact with the recommendation system and receive personalized anime recommendations.
